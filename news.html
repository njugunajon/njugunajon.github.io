        <p>Microsoft has confirmed rumors that collaboration platform Teams will be built into the core of the company’s new Windows 11 operating system.
        During the Windows 11 launch event, Microsoft lifted the lid on a new Teams integration that will allow users to launch into chats and calls with a single click or touch via an icon in the taskbar.
        According to Panos Panay, Chief Product Office at Microsoft, the new functionality will help Windows users connect more easily with work and personal contacts, no matter the device or platform they are on.

        The Microsoft Teams icon will take a front-and-center spot on the new Windows 11 taskbar, which is positioned in the middle of the screen, similar to the macOS dock. From here, users will also be able to perform actions such as muting their microphone and launching into a presentation.
        “It’s not just about creativity, it’s not just about productivity; beyond these things, there is another critical part of Windows. We want to bring you closer to the things you love, and connecting with people is at the top of that list,” said Panay.</p>
