    The iPhone 13 is coming this year, and we're now learning lots about Apple's next iPhone thanks to leaks and rumors. Don't expect the iPhone 13 range until September 2021 at the earliest, but we're now getting a good picture of what the new handsets will bring.

    These include things like upgraded cameras, a 120Hz refresh rate screen, 1TB of storage, brand new colors and a more powerful chipset. It's looking likely that these phones will mirror the iPhone 12's design, and there's also a chance we could see the phones launch under the iPhone 12S name instead of the iPhone 13 moniker.

           <h1>Hands on: OnePlus Nord N200 5G review</h1>
           <h2>The OnePlus Nord N200 5G is a promising budget phone</h2>
           <img src="oneplus.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
           <figcaption class="figure-caption">The OnePlus Nord N200 5G.</figcaption><br>
           
           <p>The OnePlus Nord N200 5G is a refreshed version of the more mid-range OnePlus Nord N100 that launched last year, with slightly better specs and, yes, 5G connectivity.While it’s no surprise that OnePlus would release another affordable phone to make a play for the budget market, it is strange that the brand is only aiming it at the US and Canada – surely there are other regions that would appreciate OnePlus’ newest cheap phone. Which, in itself, feels like OnePlus trying to return to the lean, affordable yet powerful configuration that made the brand popular.In our limited time with the phone, we felt its value come to the fore: a sleek, powerful phone with a great physical design that makes it feel more premium than its price would suggest. Its specs are reasonable but not awe-inspiring, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.The cameras leave a lot to be desired, with a 13MP main shooter taking decent photos. The other lenses – a 2MP depth and 2MP macro camera – are less interesting, and considering other budget phones are starting to feature ultra-wide cameras, it’s disappointing to see limited variety. 
Overall, the OnePlus Nord N200 5G seems to be a good budget phone with a curiously limited release plan. Doubtless users in other countries would appreciate the OnePlus polish in a more affordable phone. In any case, its low price makes it a good price for what the phone does have: specs and 5G connectivity for cheap. You can’t get much better than that.</p>
